## Code Quality (Claude 4 Guidelines)
<!-- These help ensure AI-assisted code meets quality standards -->
- [ ] **Minimal changes** - Only changes directly requested, no "improvements" beyond scope
- [ ] **No over-engineering** - No unnecessary abstractions, helpers, or future-proofing
- [ ] **General solutions** - No hard-coded values for specific test cases
- [ ] **Cleanup done** - No temporary files, scripts, or debug code left behind
- [ ] **Real validation** - Only validates at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)

## Frontend Quality (if UI changes)
<!-- Skip if no UI changes -->
- [ ] **Distinctive design** - Avoids generic "AI slop" aesthetics
- [ ] **Typography** - Uses intentional font choices, not just system defaults
- [ ] **Color coherence** - Commits to a cohesive theme with CSS variables
- [ ] **Motion** - Animations are purposeful, not scattered micro-interactions
